## How to participate

1. **Create a Shopify Partners account** (free) and set up a development store—this is where you’ll preview your work.  
2. **Fork this repository** to your personal account or organization (**Fork → Create a fork**).  
3. Work in your fork; we recommend a branch named `feature/solution`.  
4. **When you’re done**, open a **Pull Request (PR)** from your branch to `main` in *your own fork*.  
   - Leave the PR **open and unmerged** so we can review commits, diffs, and comments.  
   - In the PR **description**, paste the **theme preview link** (e.g. `https://your-dev-store.myshopify.com/?preview_theme_id=123456789`) so we can test the bundle live.  
5. Invite `@hemnys` as a *reviewer* or *collaborator* so we have access to your PR.

### Shopify Functions & Checkout UI Extensions

| What you must do | Why |
|------------------|-----|
| **Create one additional private repository** under your account (e.g. `bundle-backend`). | Keeps code that may require secrets or CI isolated from the theme fork. |
| In that repo, place **both components**:<br>• `bundle-function` (CartTransform)<br>• `bundle-checkout-extension` (UI Extension) | Centralises backend code while remaining separate from storefront assets. |
| **Open a dedicated PR to `main` for each component** (two PRs total). | Allows us to review Function and Extension independently. |
| Add **direct links** to those PRs in the README of your fork. | Fast navigation for the evaluation team. |

> **Functions or Extensions delivered without their own PRs will not be accepted.**
